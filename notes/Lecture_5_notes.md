# Lecture 5

- Show Machine specs
- Linear regression
- Use geom_smooth(method="lm"
- More points in the middle
- Mean + confidence interval (C.I. = $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$) where $\sigma$ = std.
- Compile with -03
- Redo the process
- Perhaps you cannot kill all processes
- Make a list of variations
- Randomize experiments

## Performance metrics slides

- How many times an event occurs
- Duration of a time interval
- Size of some parameter

### Metric xterization

- Reliability
- Repeatability
- Consistency
- Linearity
- Ease of measurement
- Independence

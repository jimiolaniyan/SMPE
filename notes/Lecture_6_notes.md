# Lecture 6

# Notes

## Feedback on homework

- Need to know all the variations that could affect the results of the experiments (e.g., fishbone diagram)
    - Putting all that information in a paper may be excessive so it can be put in a log file
- There may be other parameters that haven't been thought of

### Fitt's law

- Device
- Expertise of participants
- Perhaps there were distractions
- Participants may lose interest after some time

## Confidence interval activity

- How to select the number if data points to use in an experiment with averages

$Var(S_m) = \frac{Var(X)}{m}$

$Var(A+B) = Var(A) + Var(B)$
